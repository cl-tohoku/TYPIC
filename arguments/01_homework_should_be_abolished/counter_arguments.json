The parents being active or inactive in their lives is a non-consequence, the entire point is to check on the child's progress. If the homework is not done or is poorly done then a teacher can adjust to try and help the student cover the material better. If the homework is completed in a satisfactory manner then the teacher can move the child up to the next chapter in their learning.
